## [Unreleased]

## [0.1.0b1] - 2026-03-02

### Added

This is the first beta release of FIPS (Flexible Inverse Problem Solver). The project has transitioned from Calendar Versioning (2025.10.0) to Semantic Versioning to better reflect development maturity and API stability.

#### Core Framework
- **Vector & Matrix structures**: Native support for state vectors and observation vectors with pandas MultiIndex for N-dimensional alignment
- **Operators**: Forward operators (H matrix) with flexible block-based construction and sparse matrix support
- **Covariance structures**: Prior covariance (S_a), observation error covariance (S_z), and posterior covariance computation
- **Estimators**: Bayesian MAP estimation with analytical solutions for linear inverse problems

#### Data Structures
- **Block architecture**: Modular `Block` and `MatrixBlock` objects for constructing large-scale problems from heterogeneous data sources
- **Index management**: Specialized indexing tools for aligning spatiotemporal coordinates across datasets
- **Sparse matrix support**: Optimized sparse data structures for memory-efficient large-scale computations

#### Processing & Analysis
- **Filters**: Data filtering and quality control tools
- **Aggregators**: Spatial and temporal aggregation of results with coordinate preservation
- **Kernels**: Covariance kernel functions for spatial and temporal correlations
- **Metrics**: Diagnostic metrics for inverse problem solution quality

#### Specialized Applications
- **Flux inversion problem**: Domain-specific implementation for atmospheric flux estimation
- **Pipeline support**: Workflow orchestration for multi-step inverse problem solutions

#### Visualization & I/O
- **Visualization tools**: Plotting utilities for state vectors, operators, and covariance structures
- **Serialization**: Native pandas/xarray serialization for results

#### Development Tools
- Comprehensive test suite with 18 test modules covering all major components
- Full documentation with Sphinx, including API reference and example notebooks
- CI/CD workflows for testing, code quality, and documentation deployment
- Pre-commit hooks with ruff (linting/formatting) and pyright (type checking)

### Changed
- **Versioning scheme**: Migrated from Calendar Versioning (CalVer) to Semantic Versioning (SemVer)
- **Development status**: Updated from Alpha to Beta

### Notes
- This beta release is ready for testing and feedback from colleagues
- The core API is stable but may evolve based on user feedback before 1.0.0
- Installation available via pip from GitHub: `pip install git+https://github.com/jmineau/fips`
- Please report issues and edge cases at https://github.com/jmineau/fips/issues
